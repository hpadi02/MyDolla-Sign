   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Set up backend (Rene, Gauge):**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

4. **Push and create a pull request:**
